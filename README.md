# .emacs.d

This is my basic and comfy emacs configurations, suitable for beginners. 
This one helped me with the subject Data Structures, and I am looking forward
to practice python, haskell and web developing with this config. 

I wanna thank to Miguel Pi√±a, 
he was the one who introduced me to emacs many days ago,
so many that I no longer remember.
